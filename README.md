The aim is to create a new ecological system that subverts traditional technologies, to provide open learning, practice, testing and evaluation systems for teachers and students on the frontline, and to facilitate the online development of basic education.In the future, we plan to launch an international 5C high-level thinking challenge based on the 5C core literacy, recruit front-line teachers across the country to make interactive tasks based on online mass production, lead the development direction of online assessment, and provide effective paths for the development of the core literacy of primary and secondary school students.
